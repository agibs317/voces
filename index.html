<p><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i>  Dominicans, our Spanish is considered ‘ghetto’. I grew up in a city where it was mostly Dominicans and Puerto Ricans so I felt comfortable speaking the way a Dominican would. But coming to Miami and really being exposed to different Spanish speaking countries I do feel like I have to code switch with my Spanish a lot. <i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></p>

<p><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i> If our countries are not going to foster a community for us, we have to foster it for ourselves. Most people that are Afrolatinos on this campus don’t know other afrolatinos because there’s not any type of community. Especially being in a PWI you’re either Black, Latino, White, or brown so there’s no room for the mix. So definitely more community especially being in Miami we don’t fit that mold by any means. I think we have to force it to make it natural. It has to be constructed but once that happens it won’t be forced it’ll be like: this is where I can find my people. <i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></p>

<div data-aos="zoom-out-right" data-aos-duration="500" class="text-left">
<p><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i> Even on the internet, that whole meme of 'me no black' is like a big foundation of what the culture is really like. It's like a rope where we're Carribbean and we're not. I feel like it's because we speak Spanish and the European aspects of it, it's like that's the wedge that other Caribbean countries have with the Dominican Republic. Not that it's a bad thing, it almost feels like we get excluded, to be considered Black or Caribbean. <i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></p>

<div data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="500" class="text-right">
<p><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i> I would say in Puerto Rico we embrace our blackness more but there’s still that underlying racist aspect of it where for example with hair they’d call it ‘pelo malo’ which is bad hair, to refer to really coarse, and kinky hair. It’s those micro aggressions that date back to how Puerto Rico was colonized by the Spanish and how that made us a colorist society. <i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></p>

<div data-aos="zoom-out-right" data-aos-duration="500" class="text-left">
<p><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i> I definitely want my kids to speak Spanish. I also want my kids to be around Dominican culture, just like my parents have always made it intentional to visit and go back home, visit family, stay connected. I want the same thing for my children, like I want them to be connected and understand where their parents come from. <i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></p>
